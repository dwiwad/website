## About Me

<p align="justify">
I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in the <a href="https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/research/dispute-resolution-research-center.aspx">Dispute Resolution Research Center</a> of the <a href="https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/faculty/academics/management-and-organizations.aspx">Management and Organizations Department</a> at the <a href="https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/">Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University</a>
</p>

<p align="justify">
Primarily, my research focuses on uncovering the various psychological biases and misperceptions that legitimize economic inequality, even as it has risen to levels that negatively impact both organizations and society broadly. I subsequently leverage these insights to create interventions that foster egalitarian behaviors, emotions, and cognitions across public and private organizations.
</p>

<p align="justify">
I am also an avid semi-professional cyclist; I compete at the highest level across both Canada and the United States on both the road and the velodrome.
