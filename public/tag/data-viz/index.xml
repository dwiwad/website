      <title>Does High Economic Inequality, and Low Economic Mobility Threaten, the Relationship Between Income and Happiness?</title>
      <link>https://dwiwad.github.io/project/mobility_happiness/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 05 Oct 2018 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Myriad past research demonstrates a fairly strong link between money and happiness. That is, people are generally happier when they make more money up to around the $75,000 a year mark 
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/107/38/16489.full.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;(e.g., Kahneman &amp;amp; Deaton, 2010)&lt;/a&gt;. However, one possible threat to this relationship is the level of economic inequality. Really, one could imagine this relationship going in either directions. On one hand, it seems intuitive that money has more happiness purchasing-power when your immediate community is highly unequal. In this case, having a lot of money could make you more satisfied to have &amp;lsquo;made it.&amp;rsquo; On the other hand, it could be extremely uncomfortable to be on the top of the economic ladder when poverty is so readily apparent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tested this question with a set of multilevel models using four different datasets, which can be found 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dwiwad/Inequality-Mobility-Income-and-Happiness/tree/master/Data&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;survey_data.csv&lt;/strong&gt;; This dataset contains 1,441 survey responses from two qualtrics national panels. The key individual variables here are happiness, economic quintile, age, political ideology, and location (latitude and longitude). We collected these data in our lab as part of larger projects exploring the psychological correlates of perceived economic mobility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ACS_14_5YR_B19083&lt;/strong&gt;; this dataset is from the United States census and contains two county identifiers (FIPS code and county name), income inequality (Gini) for each county, and the standard error for each Gini coefficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;gini.by.state&lt;/strong&gt;; this dataset is also from the United States census and contains two state identifiers (FIPS code and state name), income inequality (Gini) for each state, and the standard error for each Gini coefficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;mobility.by.county&lt;/strong&gt;; this dataset is from the Harvard Mobility Project and contains a measure of income mobility, as well as various population demographics, for each county. The measure I will be using, absolute upward mobility, quantifies the average income percentile for a child whose parents were in the 25th percentile. So, for example, if a county has an absolute upward mobility value of 40 this means that the children of parents who were in the 25th percentile of the income distribution ended up, on average, in the 40th percentile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, some of the data was data we had collected in the past and some of the data came from established sources. The first thing I did was take a quick look at where our participants were in the United  States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=figure&gt;&lt;img src=https://dwiwad.github.io/project/Mobility_Happiness/geo_locate.png&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, we can see that the participants are pretty spread out across the United States, with a bit of a dearth in the central United States; most participants seem to be in the Eastern U.S. I used this geolocation data to assign each participant the county in which they live. I will spare you the nitty-gritty details of the multilevel modeling, but if you are so inclined you can find everything 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dwiwad/Inequality-Mobility-Income-and-Happiness/blob/master/Markdown%20Docs/MLM_Comprehensive_Exam.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I found was that, in line with past research, personal income (as measured by which income quintile the person reports being in) was a very strong predictor of happiness. In accounting for all the individual (age, gender, political ideology) and county-level (inequality) factors, it income was the only significant determinant of happiness. While I didn&amp;rsquo;t observe a significant interaction between income and happiness, suggesting that there could be a relationship here. But what does that relationship actually look like?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to take a look at this, I did a quartile split on income inequality and binned participants into four categories: extremely low inequality (gini less than .43), low inequality (gini between .43 and .45), high inequality (gini more than .45 and less than.48), and very  high inequality (gini more than .48). Then, I plotted out the simple relationshp between income quintile and happiness in each of these inequality categories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=figure&gt;&lt;img src=https://dwiwad.github.io/project/Mobility_Happiness/ineq_hap_simp.png&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you can see here pretty clearly is that the slope of the relationship in counties with less inequality (the green and orange lines) is steeper than in counties with more inequality (the purple and pink lines). That is to say, money seems to have more &amp;ldquo;happiness purchasing power&amp;rdquo; when people live in more equal communities. Just to look at this in another way, here are the data plotted as actual means instead of over simplified regression lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=figure&gt;&lt;img src=https://dwiwad.github.io/project/Mobility_Happiness/ineq_hap.png&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above presented data show that the increase we get in happiness from having more money is diminished in places with higher inequality. One possible reason for this is simply exposure to inequality through poverty. Looking only at the people who reported being in the fifth quintile, you can see that happiness is the lowest in the high and extremely high inequality places. It’s possible that in these places the high income people are exposed to more poverty, and thus feel an increased sense of wealth guilt, leading to a dampened general happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is only one possible explanation and uncovering the mechanism here requires significant further exploration. For now, I’m going to just explore the data again, this time looking at the level of absolute upward mobility present in a county, instead of inequality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;income-and-happiness-by-county-upward-mobility&#34;&gt;Income and Happiness by County Upward Mobility&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One might suspect an interaction here such that the relationship between income and happiness is stronger in places with low mobility, perhaps as a sort of dissonance mechanism. That is, when one cannot move up the income ladder they rationalize and are thus happier with their level of income, regardless. Specifically, I would think that high income people are equally happy regardless of the level of mobility, but as mobility drops the baseline level of happiness for those in lower quintiles rises. Same with the previous analysis, I&amp;rsquo;m going to spare you all the nitty-gritty modeling details here and just present the main trends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=figure&gt;&lt;img src=https://dwiwad.github.io/project/Mobility_Happiness/mob_hap_simp.png&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This actually doesnt look all that different from the inequality version of the graph, but here there is no interaction whatsoever. The slopes are all equal. Let’s take a quick look at the graph of the actual data, instead of the regression lines:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=figure&gt;&lt;img src=https://dwiwad.github.io/project/Mobility_Happiness/mob_hap.png&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking at this graph versus the graph with county inequality makes it clear there really is no interaction here, just as the MLM data show. These models suggest that the relationship between income and happiness may indeed be influenced by the level of inequality present in the county one lives. Specifically, income has greater happiness purchasing power when you live in a more equal society. Perhaps this is due to the decreased availability of visible poverty and inequality, leading to a lower sense of wealth guilt among those living in the higher quintiles. On the other hand, it is also possible that in areas with lower inequality do not suffer so much from the middle class being washed out, thus having a higher income means one’s purchasing power is higher and can live relatively better off compared with someone of the same income bracket in a high-inequality city, where their money potentiall has less purchasing power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In sum, across this analysis I: (a) cleaned and combined four separate datasets into one useable dataset with individual and county level information, (b) ran a series of multilevel models exploring the interaction of county-level data and individual level relationships, and (C) unpacked these interactions with concise data visualization. Within the analyses, I first replicated a long-standing effect showing that higher wealth is related to higher happiness, overall. I then built upon this, showing that there appears to be a modest interaction between the level of inequality where one lives and the strength of the money-happiness relationship. Particularly, it appears that the happiness-purchasing power of money is greater when one lives in a more equal county. Lastly, I found that the level of absolute upward mobility in a county does not change the nature of the money-happiness relationship&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Visualizing the Tour De France</title>
      <link>https://dwiwad.github.io/project/tdf_speed/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 27 Apr 2016 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate>
      <guid>https://dwiwad.github.io/project/tdf_speed/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this short post I&amp;rsquo;m going to do the first set of two visualizations exploring data regarding the grand tours that I pulled from Wikipedia. Specifically, here I&amp;rsquo;m going to look at a couple elements of the Tour de France over it&amp;rsquo;s entire 114 year history. Namely, I&amp;rsquo;m going to look at the length of the Tour, the average speed of the winner for each edition, their total winning time, and the margin that they won by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not intending to do any inferential analyses, but what I&amp;rsquo;m expecting to see is that the Tour is getting faster and shorter, and is being won on smaller margins as time goes on. I&amp;rsquo;m going to hide all of the code in this particular notebook, but I will display some of the raw data and explain the process as I go along just so you can see where I started and where I got to, and then what those data actually look like. If you are interested in the more technical aspects of how I did all of these analyses, there is a seperate jupyter notebook in the repository I put up on github for this particular project 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dwiwad/Analyzing-the-Grand-Tours&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. These notebooks have more detailed information on what I did step by step, including all of the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that, let&amp;rsquo;s get right into the data!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;tour-de-france-winners-data&#34;&gt;Tour de France Winners Data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I grabbed these data from the wikipedia page for Tour GC winners, which can be found here on 
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Tour_de_France_general_classification_winners&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;the wikipedia page for Tour de France GC Winners.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s take a quick look at these raw data; what does it look like once scraped from wikipedia and cleaned a little bit? Here&amp;rsquo;s the first and last five rows (i.e., the first and most recent five Tour  winners):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=figure&gt;&lt;img src=https://dwiwad.github.io/project/tdf_speed/tour_early.png&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=figure&gt;&lt;img src=https://dwiwad.github.io/project/tdf_speed/tour_late.png&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ve got a lot of interesting information in this table, including the winner, their team, the number of stage wins, etc. However, given that I&amp;rsquo;m focusing here on speed of the tour, I&amp;rsquo;m going to pull out all the information I need and put it into one smaller new table. That is, I&amp;rsquo;ll pull out the columns for distance, time, and margin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this, I&amp;rsquo;ll calculate a new column, average speed, which is simply the total distance divided by the winning time. Here&amp;rsquo;s what the new cleaned up data look like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=figure&gt;&lt;img src=https://dwiwad.github.io/project/tdf_speed/tour_clean_head.png alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;65%&#34; height=&#34;65%&#34;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=figure&gt;&lt;img src=https://dwiwad.github.io/project/tdf_speed/tour_clean_tail.png alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;65%&#34; height=&#34;65%&#34;/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So here is the data that we&amp;rsquo;re going to work with from now on. We&amp;rsquo;ve got winning time in hours, total distance in kilometers, winning margin in seconds, and then average speed in kilometers per hour. Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look now, and see how things have changed over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=figure&gt;&lt;img src=https://dwiwad.github.io/project/tdf_speed/all_in_one.png&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s tons of interesting things going on here! One thing to note first, is the blue bars correspond to missing data - as in, years where there was no Tour de France, or the Tour was structured differently. First, between 1905 and 1912 the Tour was scored on points so there is no distance and time data there. Second (and third), the Tour was not run during either of the World Wars. So, brushing over that let&amp;rsquo;s dive into the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll focus first on the top and bottom graphs, because most of the interesting stuff, in my opinion, is in the middle. First, the Tour has been getting shorter since right around WW I. This isn&amp;rsquo;t entirely surprising because back in the early 20th century the Tour was envisioned as a savage race for only the hardest men, where only one man would actually make it to the end. So, over the years the Tour has gotten shorter but still a formidable distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, the winning margin was huge back when the Tour was inhumanely difficult - the margin was in the realm of hours. However, since the 1950s the winning margin has been in the realm of minutes or seconds. We&amp;rsquo;ll dive a bit deeper into this later on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, the overall winning time and average speed. This is where stuff gets a bit more interesting! The overall winning time has been getting lower and lower, which makes sense given the tour has gotten shorter and faster. The tour has been getting consistently faster over the years, even over just the last few decades. In fact, the average speed was still around 32kmh in the early 1970s and was over 40 kmh the last few years. Thats nearly a 20% increase in average speed over four decades. Average speed seemed to increase pretty sharply from the 1960s to the early 2000s, but has seemed pretty consistent since then. I did, however, notice some interesting blips in the 1990s and 2000s. Let&amp;rsquo;s dive a little bit deeper in the speed data for those years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=figure&gt;&lt;img src=https://dwiwad.github.io/project/tdf_speed/zoomed.png&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we zoom in on the last 46 years (1971-2017) we can see this pattern a little bit more clearly. When zoomed in, the pattern of the Tour getting faster looks a little bit less remarkable, but I think it&amp;rsquo;s still quite amazing when you unpack what these numbers are actually showing. I&amp;rsquo;m going to focus on the average speed column.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While they don&amp;rsquo;t look like huge peaks, you&amp;rsquo;ll notice that the year of the Festina Affair and the last year of Lance (one year before Operacion Puerto) are the fastest edtions of the tour in the last half century - this is not over a trivial time frame. Even when you think about the advancements in bike, kit, and athlete training technology over the last decade, Lance in his last year was still faster than the current pros who have ten extra years of engineering underneath them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other bit, is that even though the slope of the average speed line doesn&amp;rsquo;t look crazy - it&amp;rsquo;s actually quite steep. The average speed of the Tour has increased by about 6 km/h since the 1970s, which is an increase of about 17%. All this while the tour has remained relatively consistent in its distance of about 3,500 km.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be nice to be able to factor in total elevation data (maybe they&amp;rsquo;re faster now because they&amp;rsquo;re climbing less), but I can&amp;rsquo;t find these data anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The general pattern seems to me to be twofold: (1) The tour is getting faster and faster and (2) There were relatively big drops in average speed after each major doping scandal, followed by slow and steady increases in speed (including over the last twelve years).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, I don&amp;rsquo;t think the Tour will actually get substantially faster without drastic changes to the route or UCI rules. For instance, I can&amp;rsquo;t see the average speed hitting the mid-forties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I&amp;rsquo;m going to zoom in a bit on the winning margins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=figure&gt;&lt;img src=https://dwiwad.github.io/project/tdf_speed/margin.png&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we zoom in on the winning margins, we can see there is still a slight slope down. The time gap to the winner is getting smaller and smaller over time. Again, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem like much but the slope of this line goes down from ten minutes in 1971 (~ 600 seconds) to just 54 seconds in 2017. Again, I don&amp;rsquo;t think there&amp;rsquo;s really anywhere to go from here though. I suspect we will just continue to see the Tour being won on margins of less than a minute for the foreseeable future, unless there are major shakeups to the UCI&amp;rsquo;s rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;limitations&#34;&gt;Limitations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest limitation of these basic visualizations, particularly the data about average speed, is that I would like to factor in the elevation gain for a given tour. The speed info is hard to interpret without it. For instance, a tour with 10 flat sprinters stages is likely to be faster, on average, than a tour with only 3. This doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean riders are getting faster overall, it just means the structure of the Tour was weighted towards faster stages. Unfortunately, I cannot find these data anywhere. I think we can assume though, that changes in the structure of the Tour don&amp;rsquo;t explain all changes in speed over the last few decades, where the race is very much a climbers race.&lt;/p&gt;
